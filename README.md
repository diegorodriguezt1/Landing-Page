# Landing-Page

This project has been created from zero but with an image of how the page had to be.

The html file and css file were the proof to see how I was going with the concepts I've being seeing in the odin project.

It was a recapitulate on structure of html with the divs and were to put all the elements for when the style part begin, were being able to position all were it go. Not just that, had to remeber the colors, font size and all atributes of flexbox.
